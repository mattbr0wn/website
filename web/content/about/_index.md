My personal mission is to help build and grow 1000 tech companies across Ascending Markets, mainly in the global South.

As an entrepreneur, I've created and built five companies in SaaS, Fintech, Communications, Venture Capital, and Media. I'm currently the CEO & Co-Founder of CustomerOS.

As an investor, I've backed over 50 Founders across 5 continents. I'm passionate about working with Entrepreneurs worldwide who share my mission of powering the future.

When I'm not building or working with entrepreneurs, you can find me writing my first book (coming soon!) or enjoying time with my family.
